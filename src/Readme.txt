Welcome to StripDice.

The rules are simple.  Everyone performs a /roll.  The low roller has to strip an item.

This facilitates the rolls, and places an icon on the high roller, and the low roller.

To start a game, someone says "roll", and everyone has 60 seconds to /roll.
The low roller gets the raid icon of choice placed on their head.

Controlling which icons are used is simple.
Use the phrase "Set the high rolls to {star} {cross}".
This sets the highest roll to {star} and the 2nd highest to {cross}.
Using "Set the high rolls to none" will clear setting icons to the high rollers.

The same can be done for the low rolls.

Setting an icon for specific roll values is just as simple.
"Set rolls 42 to {skull}" will set the skull icon on who ever rolls a 42.
This takes presedence over the high / low icons.
Use "Set rolls 42 to none" to clear the icons for that roll.



Have fun!
