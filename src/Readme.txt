Welcome to StripDice.

The rules are simple.  Everyone performs a /roll.  The low roller has to strip an item.

This facilitates the rolls, and places an icon on the high roller, and the low roller.

To start a game, someone says "roll", and everyone has 60 seconds to /roll.
The low roller gets the raid icon of choice placed on their head.

Have fun!
